# Palindrome Linked List

## Task
Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome.

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9


## Example-1
```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```


## Example-2
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```


## Flow up
Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
